# Armbian for Amlogic S9xxx STB

Compile the Armbian kernel for Amlogic S9xxx STB. There are many uncertainties in the test item, please do not use it in the project.

The extracted kernel storage path for openwrt is in the `build/output/images` directory, and the file name is `amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt-kernel-*.tar.gz`. The kernel can be used in the [hg680p-lede's kernel](https://github.com/aeroslubis/hg680p-lede/tree/main/amlogic-s9xxx/amlogic-kernel/kernel).
